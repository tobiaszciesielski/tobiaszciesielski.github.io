I feel this pressure to learn new stuff every day. No update read, no new tech tried - day lost. Especially nowadays when new tools and AI updates spring up everyday. It causes [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) all the way.

The conflict in my head is - **I hate spending more time on computer than I must.** ‚Äú9-5‚Äù and I‚Äôm done. There are so much better things to do - hang out with friends, discover new restaurants, visit new art exhibitions, do sport and attempt verity of events.

On the other hand I know that If you are not developing, you are moving backwards.

Over 5 years of my programming journey I developed things that help me to keep as updated as I can. Maybe it‚Äôs not enough but it is still something.

I am not learner. I will **not learn** without purpose.
I am achiever. I **will learn** to achieve something.

By doing ‚Äúthings‚Äù and personality tests (ex. [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx)), I discovered I am a goal-oriented person. This is key for me - setting goals.

They could be small or bigger.

By small ones I mean stepping out your comfort zone step by step.

- start sharing knowledge on blog,
- create content on social media,
- organize workshop with your teammates,

etc. (ask chatgpt for help üòú)

With big ones I mean do it or die üíÄ¬†
I totally not recommend it although they taught me the most.

What am I talking about?

- sign up for a technical talk,
- change your job or rebrand,
- start a business,

I accomplished couple bigger ones but two of them that made the biggest impact on me was:

- become a software developer - I sacrificed hundreds of hours of my spare time during studies to become one.
- Second impossible goal was talk on NgPoland - I learnt tremendous amount of stuff. From very technical around Angular and RxJS, to public speaking and storytelling.

One thing I realized by achieving these goals:

**There is no victory without sacrifice.**

If you also struggle to learn, try to set goal which you have no idea how to achieve. But remember - it has to be something you are passioned about. In other case you will burn down faster than you think.
